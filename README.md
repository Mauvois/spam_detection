# spam_detection

## Build a spam detector from the provided dataset to classify messages entered by users as “ham” or “spam”.


#### TODO

- [ ] Apply the necessary NLP preprocessing to prepare the data for the classification algorithms

- [ ] The detector must integrate two versions: one developed with Scikit-Learn and the other with TensorFlow

-[ ] The networks can be Perceptrons or MLPs (no RNN)

- [ ] Users can choose which version they wish to use

- [ ] A user interface allows the entry of new messages to classify and the version of the model (Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow) they want to use

- [x] Upload the code of the application on GitHub and invite your teammates as collaborators
